# STM32-PCB-Playground
Welcome to STM32 PCB Playground - a repository for exploring, creating, and mastering PCB designs tailored for STM32 microcontrollers.

This repository serves as my personal learning space for STM32 PCB designs, facilitating version control while also offering an opportunity to share knowledge and assist fellow enthusiasts in their learning journey. Feel free to explore, contribute, and collaborate as we delve into the realm of STM32 microcontrollers together
